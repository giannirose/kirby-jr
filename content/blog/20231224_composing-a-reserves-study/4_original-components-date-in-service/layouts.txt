This amount is multiplied by 1 plus the Inflation Rate listed on the Parameters page. This is raised to the power of, from  Parameters, the Current Planning Year minus the Date in Service.

When the next planning year rolls around, having serviced the item in the previous year, we should update that item's Date in Service to the year in which it was done and the Date in Service Cost to what was the actual cost that was paid. Having serviced that item, the cycle of that component's Useful Life begins anew.\n\nHaving covered this method of arriving at the Current Cost, I must emphasize that THIS IS NOT THE RECOMMENDED METHOD TO DO THIS. However, it is useful to set up an additional column for the page and run that formula as a check against the method we get into next.\nThe Current Cost can be derived from actual unit costs and take into consideration how many units there are and any other qualifier. \n\nThese attributes of the component are in other columns of the Original Components page.\n\nBefore leaving this section, we can note that there is another way to derive the \"power of\" number.\n\nInsted of\n```\n^ (Parameters!$C$5 - $B3)\n```\nCurrent Planning Year minus the Date in Service year we get the same result with\n```\n(Useful Life + Adjustment)\n```\nwhich in the first iteration is:\n```\n=$C3 + (1 + Parameters!$C$2) ^ ($F3 + $G3)\n```\nThis can be set up as a supplemental column as a check of the recommended formula."},"id":"d6091faa-074a-4564-8202-2407c0a511ec","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"84f02788-6f83-4cd3-847f-34914b7a2db6","width":"1/1"}],"id":"f6716caa-42fc-440f-9e34-ad632e0b6ed0"}]
