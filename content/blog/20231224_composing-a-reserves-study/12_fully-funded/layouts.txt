The Fully Funded amount that should be in the reserves account is $9,000, just what we need to pay the cost.\n\nA healthy reserves account may have around 60 - 70% of the fully funded amount for all items. An item come due will nonetheless be serviced because all items are not scheduled for any one year.  The reserves account is fluid regarding where the money actually is spent in any given year.\n\nNow let's say that same item repeats on a 3-year schedule. Ignoring inflation, the following year Fully Funded amount is $3,000, 2 years later is $6,000, and then the actual cost of $9,000 is again available in the third year."},"id":"90efdf11-f162-409f-9c1e-bcb5d6d17a96","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"ac482b33-6aef-4126-be8c-c58ddef3bd57","width":"1/1"}],"id":"2c17304c-f3de-43cd-8f7b-3dc4f7dec1e8"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://hKgmqLJx7Gma5LHw"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"93ba1b39-4d47-44c0-9092-03b6fa3c5165","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}],"id":"a516706f-1934-4c4f-b86c-272cf832fbe0","width":"1/1"}],"id":"1abbb21c-3ed3-4afc-b381-79efe23edd14"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":"We saw how the Current Cost increases year on year because of inflation. That happens to our Fully Funded amount too, so we don't simply divide any year by its Useful Life. Inflation is also worked into the formula. \n\nHere is the formula that we use to fill in all the cells:\n```\n=IFERROR(('Categorized Components'!$I3*((1+Parameters!$C$2)^(B$1-'Categorized Components'!$D3)))*IF((MOD(B$1-'Categorized Components'!$D3,'Categorized Components'!$F3))=0,1,MOD(B$1-'Categorized Components'!$D3,'Categorized Components'!$F3)/'Categorized Components'!$F3), 0)\n```\nHmmm...yeah...that is one steaming pile of formula. Let's break it down.\n\nWe use the IFERROR() Excel function to enter a zero if there is an error. We will get an error where we have blank cells on the page, so we use the Excel option to not show zero's on the page to keep our spacer cells clear when we drag the formula through them and they return an error.\n\nIf something doesn't seem right with the results on the page, we can choose to show the zero's to and then track down the problem.\n```\nIFERROR(value is not met, 0)\n```\nIn the center of the formula is an IF() function. The references in that function are looking to the Categorized Components page.\n```\nIF(Modulus((Column Heading Year - Replacement Year divided by Useful Life)) = 0, enter 1, otherwise enter Modulus(Column Head Year - Replacement Year divided by the Useful Life) divided by the Useful Life).\n```\nTo put that more simply, let's assume a Useful Life of an item of 10 years, and let's say we have had a year when the item is serviced. The next year when we calculate the full cost of the item, we will multiply that by a modulus of 1 divided by the Useful Life of 10, so we will have 1/10 of that item's cost appear as the fully funded amount.\n\nThe following year will have a modulus of 2, so we will show 2/10 of the Current Cost. When we get to the service year, the modulus will be 0 (there is no remainder of 10/10) and dividing 0 by 10 will give us an error so we enter the numeral 1 in that case only. That is why if the IF() the modulus is 0, we enter 1. \n\nThat part of the formula will work no matter what the Useful Life is. It may be 18 years for some component, and we'll have fractions such as 1/18, 2/18, 3/18 building up to the service year when we must jump in and enter one where the formula would otherwise give us 0/18 (no remainder / 18).\n\nThese items that supply the appropriate fractions are multiplying the first part of the formula, which is our Current Cost calculation for any year. We could refer to the entries on the Current Cost page, but I prefer to keep the references  to the Categorized Components page.\n```\nFully Funded = First Future Cost * (1 + Parameters!$C$2)^(Column Year - Replacement Year)\n```\n```\n'Categorized Components'!$I3*(1+Parameters!$C$2)^(B$1-'Categorized Components'!$D3)\n```\nThis is similar to the Current Cost formula. Current Cost uses the <code>Date in Service</code> cost and Fully Funded uses the <code>First Replacement Cost</code>. Also, Current Cost uses <code>(Column Year - Planning Year)</code> and Fully Funded uses <code>(Column Year - Replacement Year)</code>.\n\nWe calculate sumes for each column. The first year's sum can be compared to the total on the Original Components page and any problems with our entries tracked down.\n\nThe entire row of totals is transposed on the Cash Flow page."},"id":"87603406-e93d-4484-ab2e-744a5620beb7","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"a14cedde-69dc-4372-a17f-8060ff72c181","width":"1/1"}],"id":"ca839f9a-4684-49cb-9e9c-55d56d4f58f8"}]
