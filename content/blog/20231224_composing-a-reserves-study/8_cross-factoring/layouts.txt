That can also be a formula:\n```\nDate in Service Year = Replacement Year - Useful Life - Adjustment\n```\nand the first iteration is:\n```\n=$D3-$F3-$G3\n```\nHad this formula been used, we would get a circular reference error. \n\nWe could simply check the column entries against each other. Instead, in an adjoining column, we set up an IF() clause and use the Excel TRUE() function- here is the first iteration of that:\n```\n=IF($O3 = $B3, TRUE())\n```\nDragging this down the column should give us all TRUE responses. Otherwise there is some troubleshooting to be done.\n\n### Calculate the Current Cost from the Date in Service Cost component life details\n\nWe calculated the Current Cost from the Unit Cost and any Quantity and Qualifier. Here we use life details—Useful Life, Adjustment, and Remaining Life—to calculate the current cost.\n```\nCurrent Cost = Date in Service Cost * (1 + Inflation Rate) ^ (Useful Life + Adjustment - Remaining Life)\n```\nAnd its first iteration is:\n```\n=$C3 * (1 + Parameters!$C$2)^ ($F3 + $G3 - $H3)\n```\nWe set up a check of the results with:\n```\n=IF(Q3=E3, TRUE())\n```\n\n#### Calculate the First Future Cost using life details\nBy not subtracting the Remaining Life in the previous equation we calculate the First Future Cost.\n```\n=$C3 * (1 + Parameters!$C$2)^ ($F3 + $G3)\n```\nAnd we double-check that against the previously derived First Future Cost with:\n```\n=IF(I3=S3, TRUE())\n```\n#### Calculating the Unit Cost when we know only the Date in Service Cost\nWe entered a Unit Cost as a whole number and used that to calculate the cost of an item. It is useful to calculate that cost from other component attributes and to check our results.\n\nThe Unit Costs listed as whole numbers are the costs for the current year, even though the component may not be scheduled until future years.\n\nIf we don't have to factor a Quantity (the Quantity is 1) or a Qualifier (there is no qualifier) for our result, the Unit Cost will be the same as the Current Year cost.\n\nOtherwise, we need to get any Quantity and Qualifier to come up with the Unit Cost. Those two factors will be fixed numbers, not variables, so once those are determined we can calculate the Unit Cost.\n\n#### Calculate the Unit Cost with a Quantity and Qualifier from the Date in Service Cost\n\nIf there is a Quantity but no Qualifier, the calculation of the Unit Cost is:\n```\nUnit Cost = Date in Service Cost * (1 + Inflation Rate) ^ (Useful Life + Adjustment - Remaining Life) / Quantity\n```\n```\n=$C3 * (1+Parameters!$C$2)^($F3 + $G3 - $H3) / $K3\n```\nAnd if there is also a Qualifier we divide by that Qualifier before we divide by the Quantity\n```\n(Date in Service Cost * (1 + Interest Rate) ^ (Useful Life + Adjustment - Remaining Life / Qualifier) / Quantity\n```\n```\n=($C3 * (1+Parameters!$C$2)^($F3 + $G3 - $H3) /$J3) / $K3\n```\nBut we want one formula that we can drag down the column and give correct results. For that we check if there is a qualifier and run one formula if there is, and if there is no qualifier we run the simpler one.\n```\n=IF(ISNUMBER($J3),($C3 * (1+Parameters!$C$2)^($F3 + $G3 - $H3) /$J3) / $K3,$C3 * (1+Parameters!$C$2)^($F3 + $G3 - $H3) / $K3)\n```\nThis is an especially tricky number to arrive at, so it is beneficial to check if it matches up with the number entered in the Unit Cost column.\n```\n=IF($U3=$M3, TRUE())\n```\nThis formula can show changes as inflation affects the unit cost, so it is beneficial to refer to teh results when the study is updated to another year.\n\nThis wraps up our work on the Original Components page; it's time to categorize our components."},"id":"e007b64d-cef2-4780-923b-ec8ba9ad9a0d","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"8d6499cb-f572-4698-9472-cbdd830e16d1","width":"1/1"}],"id":"aafbc241-16a2-4ed2-87c3-02887d6ad489"}]
