Title: Categorized Components

For easy reference and understanding, we want to have the same information organized by categories, and for this we create the Categorized Components spreadsheet.\n\nThis arrangement will serve as a template for other spreadsheets we will create.\n\nOur column headings are the same as on the Original Components spreadsheet.

In the Description Cell we enter:\n```\n='Original Components'!A24\n```\nWhen we drag this across the row, we get all of the other amounts from that component entered into the respective cells as relative references; that is, the numbers on the Original Components page are reproduced on this page.\n\nRecall that the Original Components page is a \"source of truth\" Making changes there will be reflected here.\n\nOur second item, Electrical System Sub-panels Replace (1), is from line 76 of the Original Componets page, so our entry in Description for this component is:\n```\n='Original Components'!A76\n```\nDragging that across the row will enter the details from the Original Components page for that item.\n\nIt is a bit painstaking to get this page set up. You might wonder why not set up this page with the items along with the formulas we used at Original Components. One could do that.\n\nI mentioned that I am reflecting the work as it is published in our prefessionally done study. That study began with the information as it appears in the Original Components page, but did not provide this spreadsheet version of items in categories. Rather, they used a listing item by item in a series of plain text reports.\n\nI also suggested that we might add our cross-reference formulas on the Original Components page. To put those here would make a bit of a mess of this page and move us away from the Original Components page as a source of truth.\n\nIt is meticulous work to get the Categorized Components set up, but it is more useful for reference and sets a method for looking at our components that will be used on the pages we will be setting up."},"id":"76a48a55-1cd6-4645-8587-1a144cff0fb1","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"2c0d8614-06ed-4aee-aae9-994076a0dbcd","width":"1/1"}],"id":"5f3e9a19-e490-4924-aab9-c6466b6dbb21"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":"#### Side note about refering to other pages\n\nWhen we refer to, say, inflation rate on the Parameters page, we start that formula with <code>=Parameters!</code>, and here when we refer to the Original Components page we begin <code>'Original Components'!</code>.

These numbers should match the same totals on the Original Components page, so I refer to those below these sums and see that they match up. If they don't, we need to troubleshoot the problem.\n\nIf there is a discrepancy, a first step would be to see what the difference between the amounts is, then look for an item that matches that amount and see that it is being pulled into the Categorized Components page correctly. Also, check that each component on the Original Components page has a row listing on this, the Categorized Components spreadsheet.\n\nOther than the references entered row-by-row, sums are the only formulas used in this spreadsheet. In the examples, I did not sum up each category, though I created a space to do so. I don't find this information particularly necessary, but if desired, there is no reason not to do it.\n\nWere the categories to be summed up individually, we would then want to make sure that our totals for individual items are summed all together and do not include the category totals. It is a more complicated sum formula. Then the category totals can also be summed and a total derived for them. The two should match up, and that might be a useful check on the spreadsheet totals.\n\nThe most complicated setting-up of this workbook is done. We will use this organization by categories on several spreadsheets."},"id":"93ce0830-109e-432b-ba3a-7dce6135876e","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"a21da31a-7867-4adb-bca5-f6ae59636f2e","width":"1/1"}],"id":"9f8929e1-c200-40e8-a97b-3c6a91868068"}]
