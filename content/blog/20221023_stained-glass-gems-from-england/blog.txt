Subheadline: How did 19th century panels from Lancashire, England come to a church on Oregon's coast?

----

Intro:

Visitors to St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Florence, Oregon are greeted by a set of fine stained glass panels made, it would seem from evidence, in the second half of the 19th century. A couple of clues contained in the central panel fill in the story of their English origins.  

The panels are neatly installed in a single wooden frame, though it is partitioned. 

There are three distinct windows. The left- and right-hand panels share a common style; the taller center window is distinctly different.

Sheets of colored glass are cut to a pattern and these are assembled in lead channel.

A warm reddish-brown might be used for a European skin-tone. \n\nThe individual pieces of glass are fired in a kiln. When properly fired, the painted detail is permanent.\n\nAnother painting technique, silver stain, is employed in these windows. Compounds of silver, when applied to the glass and fired, develop a range of tones anywhere from a pale lemon yellow to a deep amber. The stain is fired at a lower temperature than the glass paints, and so is applied after the other painting is completed."},"id":"ebcfa74a-eb5e-4297-875f-ddc4b021d885","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"8cb98527-1980-4bcb-bee7-efe5c7888450","width":"1/1"}],"id":"03584cad-c5c4-40ad-aea6-ffdc35bc8ef0"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":"### Glass painting detailsg\n\nThe typical technique for painting a head is to first paint the heavy lines.
