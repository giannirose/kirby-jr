Title: Residential Projects

Text: 

I take on residential design projects on occasion, though sometimes I pass. The repair work keeps me mighty busy. I wish there were more folks in the area to whom I could pass on inquiries and commission opportunities.

The challenge is always to arrive at a design that addresses the purpose of the window and a style that works well for the client and the residence. As time becomes more precious, I find myself more drawn to research of what is possible with glass and pure applications. In other words, just making stuff for myself.

Pictured here is a pair of sunroom doors I call "Bugs, Buds, Berries and Butterflies."  Yes, that critter in the top right is actually a moth and not a butterly.
