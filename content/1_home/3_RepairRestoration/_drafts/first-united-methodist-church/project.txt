First United Methodist Church Historical Windows mainimgfloat mainimggrid2 First United Methodist Church, Eugene, Oregon  The First United Methodist Church narthex window The narthex window, composed of separate panels from the original church    The chapel window The <a href=http://www.preservationartisans.org/2016/10/12/povey-brothers-studio-the-art-of-stained-glass/">Povey Brothers</a> made the original panels, this one is in the chapel.   The history of the First United Methodist Church website cites 1912 as the year a new church was built at 1185 Willamette Street. That church no longer exists; a new church was built in 1968 at 1376 Olive Street, the current location.
The 1912 church had Povey Brothers windows. The examples shown here are used in the current church. 
An image from the December 6, 1980 edition of the Register-Guard shows me completing work on the narthex panel, which was actually an amalgamation from 1 wide and two slender panels that the church had in their basement.
The chapel window has an image of Christ. In 2012 Pete LaVelle and I worked on this window, replacing and patching a few pieces of glass and creating a more sound structure.    the narthex window at the First United Methodist church A detail of the narthex window    Register Guard article from December 6, 1980 December 6, 1980
