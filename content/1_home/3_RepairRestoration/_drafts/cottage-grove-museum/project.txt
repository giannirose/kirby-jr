Cottage Grove Museum mainimgfloat mainimggrid2rev Cottage Grove Museum  A window from the Cottage Grove Museum     A window from the Cottage Grove Museum    The old Catholic church houses the Cottage Grove Museum, built in the style called an “eight-sided church.”
One dedication panel had the date 1895. These may be the oldest stained glass windows in Lane County.
A number of windows had bowed out and, with the bowing, had shrunk away from the frames at the top. 
Along with some patching and replacement of shattered panels, the work involved getting the panels to be straight in their frames, re-attaching support bars, and re-puttying the windows. A Cottage Grove firm installed Lexan at the exterior for protection. This work was done in 2001.
The local lore had these windows as coming from Europe. This is not likely because the opalescent glass is all of domestic U.S. production.
However, the central images show painting and etching techniques, sometimes on flashed glass; these details may well be of European origin. I speculate that the central images may have been ordered from a different studio, perhaps from Europe, or perhaps from a sort of catalogue or supply house and incorporated into the larger design.
I was told that one window had fallen out during the Columbus Day storm. This is, without doubt, the Holy Spirit/dove window. The central image is rendered in a style different than all the other windows, employing none of the European glass or sophisticated techniques typical of the other central images.
