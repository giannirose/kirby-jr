English Style glass  English-style glass: British or not? There is a common style of leaded panel that I think of as “English Style.” Some characteristics are a preponderantly clear textured panel with a simple and boldly colored center,
The most common colors are red, amber and green. They are not subtle blends- the reds are red or rose, the greens are green, etc. Blue and purple are less common. 
Simple floral or geometric designs are centered in the panels.
The lead used is of a substantial size. The panels are as often as not in window sash, evidence they had been part of a home.
I think England because the glass often has textures that that were not produced by the old U.S. glass companies, and I am not familiar with this style of window being widely used in U.S. homes, yet these windows are abundant.
The wide lead helps these windows hang together. If the panel needs to be removed from the frame, the border lead is usually deteriorated and needs to be replaced.
