 Mosaic School at Ravenna mainimgfloat mainimgstackrev Mosaic School at Ravenna  Ravenna Bird Ravenna Bird    Mosaic A mosaic I made at Ravenna   These two mosaics were made at a one-week workshop of the Mosaic Art School of Luciana Notturni in Italy’s mosaic-rich Ravenna,  a UNESCO world heritage site. Here are my notes from the mosaic school.
Ravenna, with its 5th and 6th century basilicas, baptisteries and mausoleums, is the world’s largest repository of the Byzantine style of mosaics during a great period of the art form.
Represented are mosaics tied directly to  the Byzantine rulers Justinian and Theodora and the Empress Galla Placidia and the Ostrogoth ruler Theoderic.
Luciana Notturni is a world expert on classic mosaic technique, a warm personality, a wonderful teacher. The classes are in English. We had a translator for those times when Luciana wished to speak in technical Italian terms and leave the translation to an English translator.  
The focus is on making a classical piece following tracings of actual parts of the mosaics in situ in the town. If one is completed, there may be time to make a mosaic of one’s own design using the materials in the studio. A guided tour of most of the monuments is part of the class.
