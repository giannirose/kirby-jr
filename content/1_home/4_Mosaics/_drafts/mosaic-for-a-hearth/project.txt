Triptych mainimggrid Mosaic for a hearth  A mosaic for a hearth   "Bosco" This mosaic, designed to fill an area over a hearth, measures 26” x 57” and is made of smalti, essentially the same material used in Byzantine mosaics, though today we have a broader palette, especially in reds and oranges.
It was conceived as a triptych, a classical touch echoing the folding screens of religious connotations.
When I took the workshop in Ravenna, this was criticized for using the “industrial” form of the mosaic, by which Luciana meant that I had used the cut tesserae as they arrived from the manufacturer, and hadn’t given the work the personal touch of re-shaping pieces before applying.
Another classical principle not followed- ending lines with triangular shapes. I simply used the squared ends, but I still like this composition.    A detail of a mosaic A detail of "Bosco"    A mosaic A study in blue
