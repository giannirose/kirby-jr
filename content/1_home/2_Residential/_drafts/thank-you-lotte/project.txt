Thank you, Lotte! mainimgfloat mainimagegrid1 Thank you, Lotte!  A window for a bath    A local hero is Lotte Streisinger, a founder of Eugene’s still-vibrant Saturday Market. Lotte included me in the Craftsmanship 1976 exhibit at the University of Oregon Museum of Art, commissioned this early window for her home, and shepherded me into the realm of public art when she managed the Crafts portion of the Hult Center for the Performing Arts permanent artwork.
Lotte’s own professionalism and respect for skills and talent couldn’t help but rub off on me, and my life was influenced in the most positive ways.
The design for her home has been a source for other projects.    Window for a bath     D
