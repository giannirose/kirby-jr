 My First Fair 1974 Already experienced in stained glass, I found purchase in a house of fellow artists when I came to Eugene in July, 1974.
For that September’s last Renaissance Fair, house mother Indra (a Radar Angel) organized the household as a food booth. There was room in front of the booth for me to hang my stained glass.
There I got my first two commissions, both for schoolbuses—rolling homes.
One was for David (fair truck-driver) and clothing-maker Bonnie Durant’s bus, the other for Darrell and clothing-maker Jennifer’s.
As always, this year we’ll be at the same booth #350—Glass O’Rama— on what came to be named Sallie’s Alley. 
I’m curious to know of others who may have 45 or more years selling. I do know that Bill Moore, selling various crafts over the years, in booth              began his fairs in the Hawkins Heights years.        stained glass window Bonnie &amp; David’s bus window. Remember the bus windows you’d grab and lift up? This was the top half of one of those.    stained glass window I thought of this as Jennifer’s window, though she was wilder than this. Maybe it was something inside her.    stained glass window
