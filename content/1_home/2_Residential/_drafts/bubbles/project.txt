Bubbles mainimggrid mainimgstackrev Designing and drawing with bubbles  A panel based on a Degas pastel The voids in the center layer read as the lines in the composition    A sidelite detail Small colored dots between two full-size pieces of clear glass create a "halo" of air around each dot.   As I began fusing glass, many a happy accident featured air bubbles trapped between layers. I began controlling these bubbles, using them as design elements.
It is easy enough to create random visual textures with bubbles. A further area of study was creating air pockets between fused layers that would be bubbles of shapes I more or less controlled. These bubbles read much like a line on a page, and so one can “draw” with them.
The most controlled version of this was translating some Degas pastels of a woman in the bath to glass, basically making a monochromatic drawing from Degas’ colored originals.
Other examples shown here is a very early use of small colored glasses between layers- here the bubbles are not the main feature.
