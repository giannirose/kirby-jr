Headline: Craftsman Style

Subheadline: Inspired by the work of the Arts & Crafts movement and Frank Lloyd Wright

----

Intro:

The design sensibilities of the Arts & Crafts movement and of Frank Lloyd Wright fit well with many a home. It is no wonderâ€”their work is based on sound and pleasing design principles. 

These pieces owe a debt to those styles; I try to bring something fresh.
