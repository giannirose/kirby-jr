Matching Glass  #### Matching Glass: It’s not always easy
Many older curved glass lamps have glass made companies still in producition,  Kokomo Opalescent Glass (KOG) and the Paul Wissmach Glass Company. Since the later 1970’s, some curved and many stained glass lamps may be of Spectrum Glass.
Shake-up in the industry
As I write this in 2018, Spectrum Glass has stopped production but has announced that some of their styles will be produced by Oceanside Glass &amp; Tile, which is also producing limited styles of another company that closed in 2018, [Uroboros Glass](http://www.uroboros.com/about.php “Uroboros Glass “about” page”), a maker of many fine Tiffany reproduction and other unusual mixes.
Bullseye Glass has remained in production. Their glass is found in some lamps, more often stained glass lamps than curved glass.
Matching Color, Style, and Glass “Density”    mainimgfloat mainimggrid2rev  Matching Color  A curved glass lamp with hard-to-match colors     A curved glass lamp with hard-to-match colors    This lamp had glass that was particularly hard to match. There was a texture to the glass which was on the inside of the lamp, and the red and yellow were both very deep, rich colors. In this case, there was one particular part of one particular sheet of Uroboros Glass which proved adequate for the 2 pieces that needed replaced.
As a priority, I try to match glass that matches when illuminated, but we also want a good match of the reflected color when the lamp is not lit.  
Along with the shake-up in the industry described above, there has been a slow-down in stained glass in general, meaning that the supply houses stock fewer varieties of glass, which sometimes makes matching an odd color mix impossible.      mainimgfloat mainimggrid2  Matching Style  A curved glass lamp whose glass style could not be matched     A curved glass lamp whose glass has been completely replaced    The original version of this lamp featured a colorless glass with “ribbed” glass, raised straight line channels of glass, which did a good job of diffusing the glass but which could not be matched. 
The decision was made to replace all the glass with a caramel/white mix which is common in the oldest of lamps. 
Special pricing is available when glass cannot be matched and you decide to replace all panels.      Matching Glass Density figcap_rt  A curved glass lamp    A favorite type of curved glass lamp is where an entire scene is rendered in the metal work. A picture of this lamp was sent to me, and both the multi-colored glass and the green glass at the “skirt” looked like glass that I could match.
Panels were removed by the Panamanian owner, and when they arrived and I compared the multi-colored sample with my available glass, the color mix was pretty good but the original glass was much more dense than what I had. That is, when I held the existing curved panel with my available glass in lamp light, my replacement glass appeared way too bright.
In some cases, there is not much to be done except to replace all the panels with a similar color mix. Another less acceptable alternative is to alternate lighter and darker panels when the panel count permits.
in this case, because one doesn’t usually see up into the lamp, there was another option- to make the replacement panels appear more dense- to read as “darker”.    mainimgfloat mainimggrid2rev    An original glass panel and two replacement panels that have been painted An original panel (center) flanked by two painted replacement panels    One original and two painted replacement panels A close density match achieved with "bendable blendable" glass paints   There is a type of glass paint known as “bendable blendable” that offers colors that can be mixed and fired onto the glass to make the paint permanent. In this case, to make the glass read as “darker” or more dense, the best choice is to use white paint. A black or grey paint makes the colors muddy; the white paint preserves most of the luminosity. 
One can see the result in these panels . The two existing panels in the lamp had enough variation that the two new panels blended in quite well.
In many situations one can see the interior of the lamp, and this solution would be objectionable, but in some cases it can be used with a measure of success.
