Simple and Complex Shapes mainimgfloat mainimggrid2rev Simple and Complex Shapes Simple Shapes  A curved glass lamp of medium complexity While the bend is rather extreme, I classify this as a simple bend.  Simple and Complex Shapes  Glass panels with compound curves While this simple bend has compound curves, they are not too extreme.   Here are a couple of somewhat extreme shapes that I still consider “simple.”
Pricing: $95 for the initial panel; $55 for each additional panel.
I have a write-up on installing panels held by clips, and the same tips, in reverse, can be followed to remove an intact panel for shipping.      mainimgfloat mainimggrid2  Complex Shapes  A complex curved glass lamp Curves like these make for a complex shape    a curved glass lamp of complex shapes This is an unusual shape- quite complex!   The lamps pictured here are a common type of lamp and typical of what I consider a complex shape.
Pricing: $125 for the initial panel and $67.50 for each additional panel. Smaller “crown” pieces: $25 each.
  
These lamp panels are usually wrapped in a metal channel. To get an intact panel from which to make a mold, the channel needs to be un-soldered from the rest of the lamp.
Considerable metal work is needed to fit the new glass to the channel and get everything back in place.
Usually, the entire lamp must be shipped, as removing and replacing panels is specialized work.
