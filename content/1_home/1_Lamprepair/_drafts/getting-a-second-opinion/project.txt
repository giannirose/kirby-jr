Finding Help Locally and Getting a Second Opinion Finding help locally
While I do all types of repair, sometimes your problem can be taken care of by a local professional. This is especially true if the lamp is made from flat rather than curved parts, or if some straighforward re-soldering is needed to repair or re-attach a metal part.
A good place to start is at whatever stained glass supply house is closest to you. They will either be able to make the repairs themselves, or they should know the local person with the best skills to work on your lamp. If you’re having trouble locating anyone, let me know where you live and I can do a quick search and see if I come up with someone to contact. You may be able to save considerable money and time; otherwise, I’m happy to do the work.
Getting a second opinion and quote
I believe that good work is done by Curran Glass of Elmwood Park, Illinois- near Chicago.
Also, the supply house Whittemore-Durgin of Rockland, Massachusetts offers curved glass repairs. 
If you are near either of these companies, you may save the cost and trouble of shipping.
If you are a maker of curved glass panels, please contact me to be listed.    mainimgfloat mainimggrid2rev    A traditional copper foil lamp A copper foil lamp- the pieces are cut from a flat sheet of stained glass    The structure is like most curved glass lamps, but the pieces are all straight The structure is like most curved glass lamps, but the pieces are all straight   Here are lamp types that can be repaired locally if a skilled stained glass person is somewhere in your area. 
Many lamps, complicated or not, are assembled as in the first example from flat pieces of glass. Each cut piece is wrapped with an adhesive copper foil which takes solder readily. Broken pieces can have their edges un-soldered and new pieces can be inserted.
The second example resembles the form of many curved glass lamps- a metal framework into which glass panels are inserted. In this example, the glass pieces are straight. If a matching glass can be found at a stained glass supply house in your area, this can be cut and inserted. If metal clips for holding the glass are loose or missing, someone with good soldering skills can attache them in a sound way.
