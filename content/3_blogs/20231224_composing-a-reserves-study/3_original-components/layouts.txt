Each component of the study is listed along with its attributes. These are the key amounts that are referenced throughout the workbook. A change here will ripple through the workbook results.\n\nShown below are all the columns and some of the rows of the Original Components page. The page will be whatever length is needed to list all the components.\n\nThis list is sorted first by replacement year; then, within any given year, the component names are listed alphabetically."},"id":"4cf6898f-a7c5-4704-a893-6f4817e26530","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"52f2277a-8397-4325-9d27-b5afcfdcd059","width":"1/1"}],"id":"7d8aee79-d35c-44d6-be86-0f4bef0e5997"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://Xy7yBbOMeOxfGveX"],"src":"","alt":"Reserves components are listed in rows and their details in columns","caption":"","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"840b9cf4-1509-4f63-8b84-31151b044567","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}],"id":"51b5a132-e1f1-4e2d-9a03-d2c5ce59b15d","width":"1/1"}],"id":"24dfb48b-9594-4977-8f31-55e4081516fd"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":"An ultimate goal of this page is to determine the Current Cost of each component.  \n\nBefore looking at that cost calculation, let's focus on how the various time attributes are attached to each component."},"id":"05cab1fb-e0a9-420d-b7d0-f20464d71d53","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"aeb0dd29-3779-48e3-891e-5e40a8d4ff55","width":"1/1"}],"id":"ccfc39ee-8198-463c-9add-e24d122f5d1f"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":"#### Date in Service and Date in Service Cost\nWhen a component is serviced, a record is kept of the year and the cost. This is recorded in columns B and C, Date in Service and Date in Service Cost.\n\nWe'll skip, for now, columns D and E to look at Useful Life, Adjustment, and Remaining Life.\n#### Useful Life\nThe Useful Life of the component could be based on how long the component actually functioned, product information,  a warranty (such as a roofing warranty), some requirement such as a required test of the item, or a manufacturer's or contractor's information or best guess,.\n#### Adjustment\nAdjustment is some change, either more years or fewer, to the Useful Life.\n\nFor example, a warranty on a roof may expire while it is still in good shape so it's replacement is adjusted to some number of years into the future. Maybe the board decides to move up the painting of the lobby. Perhaps a part doesn't last as long as expected (a negative adjustment)."},"id":"a50265c4-627b-4557-8229-ead01de9223d","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"5d2f7aa6-608c-4e7b-a23d-7241253331c5","width":"1/2"},{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://pJgjarkhTYBjquCv"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"a8191ef0-3036-4ba0-ab0a-7c1fb1695170","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}],"id":"c257b2f5-399d-4a6d-ac61-2424a787a40f","width":"1/2"}],"id":"90892ac2-79a0-4c25-a758-d755a1e4a78d"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":"Another example: Sometimes it is determined or discovered that an item has gone without being listed or serviced. That item will ge given a reasonable Useful Life, and the elapsed time when it was not listed or considered is added as an Adjustment.\n\nAdjustments may be set to 0 or left blank once an item is serviced and we know the updated actual cost and useful life.\n\n#### Calculating the Replacement Year (Column D)\n\nThe Replacement Year is when the item is scheduled to be serviced. We use a formula to do this:\n\n<pre><code>Replacement Year = Date in Service + Useful Life + Adjustment</code></pre>\n\nOn our spreadsheet the first example of this is:\n```\n=B3 + F3 + G3\n```\nThat formula is then dragged down the column to give the Replacement Year for each item.\n#### Calculating the Remaining Life\nWe use the Replacement Year and the Planning Year from our Parameters page to calculate the Remaining Life\n```\nRemaining Life = Replacement Year - Planning Year\n```\nOn the spreadsheet our first example is:\n```\n=$D3-Parameters!$C$5\n```\nThat is dragged down the column to give all the results. The reference to the planning year is an absolute reference. Using the dollar signs mean that the formula will always use what is entered on that page in that column and that row in the formula.  The first item will always refer to Column D but the row reference will change as the formula is dragged down the column."},"id":"9f0eb578-6e05-43a8-98f1-73d3d6724ac8","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"cd887251-1496-4afb-9895-81b4b8545f40","width":"1/1"}],"id":"e47d2e15-ac24-467a-a0d4-5c172a3bda34"}]
