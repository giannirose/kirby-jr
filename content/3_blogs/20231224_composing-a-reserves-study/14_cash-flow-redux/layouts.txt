A helpful hint is to click the Control key when horizontal scrolling and the choice will be restricted to that row- no accidental going up or down and having the incorrect cells appear in the formula.\n\nComplete this part of the formua with a parenthesis, then- VERY IMPORTANT- click Control -> Shift -> Enter. Clicking only Enter will not work.\n\nI find getting the desired result the first time is tricky, but persist and we'll end up in the formula bar:\n```\n{=TRANSPOSE(B127:AE127)}\n```\nIt does not work to type this (with your actual cell range) into the formula bar. One must do the Control -> Shift -> Enter.\n\nUsing a formula that makes a relative reference to the cells means that any change on the Current Cost spreadsheet totals will be carried onto the Cash Flow page.\n\nOne could also go down the column and enter, in the first case:\n```\n='Current Cost'!B$127\n```\nFollowed by\n```\n'Current Cost'!C$127\n```\nand so on until all the cells are filled. I haven't figured a simpler way than TRANSPOSE() that also maintains the relative reference, but would be happy to learn one as TRANSPOSE() always gives me a hard time.\n \n#### Annual Contribution\n\n<code>Annual Contribution = Previous Year Contribution * (1 + Contriubtion % Change)</code>\n\nThe first instance of this is the row 2024. It relies on the contribution from the previous year which we can bring in from the Parameters page with:\n```\nParameters!C10\n```\nThis amount is then used to calculate the annual contribution by applying whatever percentage we have entered in the Contribution % Change column.\n\n<code>=C2*(1+I3)</code>\n\nThat first instance can be entered and then dragged down the column to have the formula apply for the 30-year scope.\n\nI find it useful to use the Contribution % Change to guide the budgeting for the Annual Contribution. One could also simply choose amounts year by year and change the Contribution % Change percentage to reflect whatever numbers are entered. I'll cover that when we get to a look at that last column of the page.\n\n#### Annual Interest\n\nThe formula for calculating the Annual Interest is:\n\n<code>Parameters!$C$3(1-Parameters!$C$4)(F2+(1*('Cash Flow'!$C3-'Cash Flow'!$E3)))</code>\n\nThe first instance, which can then be draged down the column, is:\n```\nParameters!$C$3*(1-Parameters!$C$4)*(F2+(1*('Cash Flow'!$C3-'Cash Flow'!$E3)))\n```\nI have also seen it recommended that the last part of that formula, <code>(1*('Cash Flow'!$C3-'Cash Flow'!$E3)</code> be written <code>(.5*('Cash Flow'!$C3-'Cash Flow'!$E3)</code>\n\n#### Annual Expenditure\nWe want to get the yearly totals from the Expenditures page, so we use the TRANSPOSE() function as above on the Expenditures page and end up with a formula:\n```\n{=TRANSPOSE(Expenditures!(B127:AE127)}\n```\n\n#### Project Ending Reserves\n```\nProject Ending Reserves = Previous Year's Ending Reserves + Annual Contribution + Annual Interest - Annual Expenditure\n```\nwhich in the first example that can then be dragged down the column is:\n```\n=(F2+C3+D3)-E3\n```\nRecall that F2 is the project ending reserves from the year previous to the study which is brought into this page with <code>Parameters!C9</code>.\n\n#### Fully Funded\nThis is our final TRANSPOSE() exercise and it should something like:\n```\n{=TRANSPOSE(B127:AE127)}\n```\nexcept that your range will probably be on a different row.\n\n#### Percent Funded\nPercent Funded is where we can gauge how we're doing. As mentioned earlier, one often sees 60% - 70% funded as fairly healthy. The formula to calculate this is:\n```\nPercent Funded = Project Ending Reserves / Fully Funded\n```\nIn the first instance, which can then be dragged down the column, this is:\n```\n=F3/G3\n```\n\n#### Contribution % Change\nThis is my own addition to the Cash Flow page. It is very useful for planning and for gauging how the rate of the Annual Contribution is increasing or decreasing.\n\nWe saw at Annual Contribution how a formula can be used so that the contribution reflects a percentage change entered in this column. If we simply want to enter figures in Annual Contribution, we can do that and then have the change reflected in the Contribution % Change column with this formula:\n```\nContribution % Change = 1 - (Annual Contribution / Previous Year's Annual Contribution\n```\nexpressed in the first instance with:\n```\n=C3/C2\n```\n\nAnd that's the Cash Flow page!"},"id":"203ed5f3-d27c-414a-98fb-1ef9f125cd12","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"e98762b6-6aa2-4372-943e-751c8b4d20bd","width":"1/1"}],"id":"9c6434df-e25f-4e93-921a-aa606f457097"}]
