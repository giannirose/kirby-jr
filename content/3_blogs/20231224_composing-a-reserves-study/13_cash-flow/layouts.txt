Title: Cash Flow

----

Layout: [{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":"### The Cash Flow page (spreadsheet)\n\nThe key details of a reserves study are summed up on the Cash Flow page, where we can see at a glance the degree to which anticipated costs are covered by expected income. It shows, year-by-year, the money coming in and going out for the maintenance, repair and replacement of items serviced on a regular basis over the upcoming thirty years.\n\nThe Cash Flow page has items entered into the columns. Some columns are total amounts pulled in from other pages ((link: https://web.pdx.edu/~stipakb/CellRefs.htm#:~:text=Relative%20cell%20references%20are%20basic,across%20to%20the%20next%20cell. text: relative references)), and some are calculations made with elements of the Cash Flow page.\n\nColumns B, E and G—Current Cost, Annual Expenditure and Fully Funded—are totals pulled in from other spreadsheets in the workbook.\n\nSince the Cash Flow page is the great summing-up of all the other information we have yet to establish on other spreadsheets within the workbook, we will return to Cash Flow toward the end of this article once we understand the elements that feed into it."},"id":"a4940ad8-aed0-4c90-bce5-041524aab3e5","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"30b42d6e-4d13-4663-9716-d73744dfdf83","width":"1/1"}],"id":"acd32b23-6856-43d3-bbf5-6c77f3e1aeb8"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://keV7oPx05WjvrRmp"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"199a1f5b-8bfd-49c0-9726-4a9477401689","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}],"id":"e3260cd1-a2ba-482a-a16d-6e346eca1b29","width":"1/1"}],"id":"139bb66f-4626-45ea-b351-79eeacee9df9"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":"<ul><li>This study example begins at year 2024, but there are a couple of items from 2023 that are refered to in the page's formulas, so those amounts are listed.</li><li>Current Cost entries are totals that will be pulled in from the Current Cost page. The Current Cost of a component is what servicing that item would cost in the current year, even though the item may not be scheduled for many years to come.</li><li>Annual Contribution is an amount set by the HOA board. It is the main income into the reserves account.</li><li>Annual Interest is calculated from the amount in the reserves account and is a small part of the yearly income into the reservces account.</li><li>Project Ending Reserves is the total in the reserves account after all yearly income is reported and the expenses are paid.</li><li>Fully Funded amounts are yearly totals pulled in from the Fully Funded page. It is the cumulative amount to date that would be in the account were all the items fully paid to date, with the understanding that equal amounts, with inflation costs added, will continue to be contributed before the item is actually serviced. I find this the trickiest item to understand.</li><li>Percent Funded is very useful for understanding the readiness of the HOA to pay for the reserves items. A figure right around 60% - 70% is cited as being good. Higher levels of funding are even better but rare in the real world.</li><li>Contribution % Change is not always on a cash flow page. It is useful for tracking year-by-year changes to the HOA dues—the Annual Contribution—and can help in creating scenarios for future payments.</li></ul>"},"id":"9925292a-e5b9-4d6e-84e9-2ab68a7e280d","isHidden":false,"type":"list"}],"id":"117f07c8-bb83-49af-bdfc-bfaeaa1488d4","width":"1/1"}],"id":"53fe9d80-3404-413d-aa05-7b4281e12def"}]
