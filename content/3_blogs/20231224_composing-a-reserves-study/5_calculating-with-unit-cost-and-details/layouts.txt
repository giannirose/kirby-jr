Working with Unit Cost, that should already be factored in, so the formula is straightforward.\n```\nCurrent Cost = Unit Cost * Quantity\n```\nand this first iteration at the Current Cost cell is:\n```\n=M3 * L3\n```\nWe must also consider if there is a qualifier. There is an example on row 23 and is for \"Concrete Pavement - Repair Allowance.\" It is calculated using the full cost of replacing all the concrete Pavement—all 3,380 square feet of it—but since this is just for some repair, it was decided that 6% of that total cost would cover a typical repair."},"id":"0d216f0d-adef-4b7e-a252-df5eeebe6979","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"22aff53d-e4bd-4952-8692-849560d2905c","width":"1/1"}],"id":"4cce2bbc-1e45-40c2-9ed6-c31929741b11"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://MIwsjjLYbDD6PBI0"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"13ce31a1-becf-46a8-85ae-6526281c9206","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}],"id":"8d06a4cc-88d1-4190-b550-77f6c755334f","width":"1/1"}],"id":"2c7c3c79-97f3-4678-be54-5dd695f6a167"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://AhOFHwbFdY96Dl0H"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"697d32d4-2d93-472f-bb0e-a96c768fac59","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}],"id":"8ff23058-105f-4a93-b530-e5e00811d7f2","width":"1/1"}],"id":"fc54effc-a1d7-49b3-99ed-1fcae5ef1ea8"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":"The formula for this is:\n```\nCurrent Cost = (Unit Cost * Quantity) * Qualifier\n```\nIn this case, the item is on row 23 so that formula at thata row is:\n```\n=(M23 * L23) * J23\n```\nThe quantity and the qualifier are fixed amounts. The Unit Cost is variable year to year and should change with inflation.\n\nWe want one formula that will work in every case. We could use the last formula given above, but I prefer to check if there is a qualifier and run the one formula, and if the qualifier cell is blank run the other. The following will work in the first Current Cost cell and can then be dragged down the column to make each calculation and it will work whether or not there is a qualifier.\n```\n=IF(ISNUMBER(J3), (K3*M3)*J3, K3*M3) \n```\nThe formula checks if there is a qualifier and, if there is one, runs the formula that takes it into account. Otherwise the formula that multiplies the unit cost times the number of units is used.\n\nThe unit cost, like all our expenses, is affected by inflation. When preparing the next year's reserves study, these unit costs should be increased to reflect the inflation rate."},"id":"efdc2ac1-de37-4035-b18c-181c4049fb87","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"32370873-ff90-4595-9e02-24befde775ea","width":"1/1"}],"id":"04688215-d92a-4c59-9515-87c24fc732d1"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://NgdFtG358g9AQVZ4"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"6f8a2d7b-a95c-4623-88e3-9d7137fd4e39","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}],"id":"9ed62af8-f2b3-4615-8988-75c17a09ab5f","width":"1/2"},{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":"Focusing on the items to be done in the current year (in our example 2024), we see the previous Date in Service listed.

Were we to change the Date in Service item to reflect the year we are in (current planning year 2024) with the 2024 cost the formula will look like this:\n```\n=1976 * (1+ .037) ^ (2024 - 2024)\n``` \nAnd the outcome of that is also 1976. Yes, an item to the power of 0 (2024 - 2024) is itself and not, as in multiplication, 0.\n\nThe formal reserves study for our HOA that I am reflecting here uses the latter method of listing, but I like seeing the timing of the previous iteration.\n\nSo...our method of arriving at Current Cost is to use the unit cost plus any quantity and qualifier. \n\nOne might add the alternate method in an additional column. The result should be the same, and if they are not, some troubleshooting can resolve the discrepancy.\n\nWith Current Cost calculated, we can add a sum of that column. We will see where this is useful when we create a spreadsheet that calculates all the current costs over the study's full 30 years."},"id":"4b79ae51-62cf-4557-b273-13b648051362","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"375c3bff-cea0-49e3-b981-4337e87bc3a1","width":"1/1"}],"id":"5e78d1fd-c6f0-4cad-9ce9-a9a7abcd2ec2"}]
