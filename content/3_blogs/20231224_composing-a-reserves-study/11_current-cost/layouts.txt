Now we're back to the simpler core of that calculation.\n\nThe Column Head Year is simply whatever year is at the top of the column on this Current Cost page.\n```\nCurrent Cost * (1 + Inflation Rate)^(Column Head Year - Current Planning Year)\n```\nIn the first instance this is:\n```\n='Categorized Components'!$E3*(1+Parameters!$C$2)^(B$1-Parameters!$C$5)\n```\nThat can be dragged down Column B, then across the full 30 years of the study. \n\nIn our example, substituting in the original cell's numbers, we have:\n```\n=30000 * (1 + .037) ^ (2024 - 2024)\n```\nThat may look odd. The \"power of\" is equal to 0. That condition will return the original current cost with no inflation applied. The following year, <code>(2025 - 2024)</code> will return 1, and the inflation rate will be applied once, and so on.\n\nWhen the entire study is updated for next year, we can see here what the then-new \"Current Cost\" amounts should be.\n\n#### Highlighting the actual expenditures amounts in the correct year \n\nThe image of the page has cells with the grey background and a thin border. You will remember that the Expenditures page listed only those items in the year when they are being carried out. \n\nWe use the Excel feature of conditional formatting to apply that background and border (or whatever other setting one might want) when the amounts on this spreadsheet match up with the amounts that appear on the Expenditures page. \n\n#### Conditionally format the expenditures years"},"id":"f324339d-9085-4e8b-bbb7-d09ce9eac87e","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"fb4faa5c-1a3c-4f4a-bfd0-2ce819a10425","width":"1/1"}],"id":"e15bdd51-71a7-40f1-931b-2199c5ace4fa"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":"We go to the Conditional Formatting section in the Excel editing options or toolbar. \n\nWe create the custom format to appear when the item in the Current Cost page matches the amount in the Expenditures page. \n\nWe do this for the full range of cells where the items costs are calculated.\n\nThis is just a helper to identify the years when the expenditures are scheduled to occur.\n\nThis conditional formatting is also used on the Fully Funded page."},"id":"49a8bd93-4154-4350-97c4-14eaa84ffcf7","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"28f98bb3-51f3-4eb2-bc8f-44be11d1bb60","width":"1/2"},{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://Criafp4KH0TbmLsI"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"577b5718-af22-43ca-9e05-2c7572b4073b","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}],"id":"10f8f124-edd1-4661-a6b9-ec61317a1e9f","width":"1/2"}],"id":"7ef7f1e3-3b91-458f-ad03-796d1477ef24"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"text":"We again set zeros not to show at the Excel menu: Excel -> Preferences -> View."},"id":"6b51867f-e7c8-4435-b4ac-aa8b1d5c6bba","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"c9b3e392-ff6c-44ed-b033-6a143319e3bd","width":"1/1"}],"id":"1a2328bb-3735-4d4c-a62a-cfc3b5c33b5e"}]
