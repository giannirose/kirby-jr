This example study begins at year 2024, but there are a couple of items from 2023 that are refered to in the page's formulas, so those amounts are listed.</li><li>Current Cost are totals that will be pulled in from the Current Cost page. The Current Cost of a component is what it would cost in the current year, even though the item may not be scheduled for many years to come.</li><li>Annual Contribution is an amount set by the HOA board. It is main income into the resercves account</li><li>Annual Interest is calculated from the amount in the reserves account and is a small part of the yearly income into the reservces account.</li><li>Project Ending Reserves is the total in the reserves account after all yearly income is reported and the expenses are paid.</li><li>Fully Funded amounts are pulled in from the Fully Funded page. It is the cumulative amount to date that should be in the account for an item, with the understanding that equal amounts will continue to be contributed before the item is actually serviced. Once we understand Fully Funded, everything else is gravy.</li><li>Percent Funded is very useful for understanding the readiness of the HOA to pay for the reserves items. A figure right around 60% - 70% is cited as being good. Higher levels of funding are even better but rare in the real world.</li><li>Contribution % Change is not always on a cash flow page. It is useful for creating scenarios to determine annual contributions that meet the needs of the HOA planned spending on reserves items.</li></ul>"},"id":"8326d135-0b4c-413f-9861-3ff9ae602af2","isHidden":false,"type":"list"}],"id":"c0402221-e5c9-4d8f-8eeb-e52138267210","width":"1/1"}],"id":"49cff0ba-fcd1-4e08-bca7-310817df5149"}]
