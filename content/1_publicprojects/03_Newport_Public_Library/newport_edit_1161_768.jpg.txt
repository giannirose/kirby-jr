Coverintro:

Newport is an Oregon coastal city with a great cultural life.  
A favorite story is that I first designed a window that metaphorically evoked light overshadowing darkness, knowledge driving out ignorance. The presentation did not go well.  
"We're all about the water here" was the message from the jury, so I did as watery a design as I could conceive.
