Introtext:

The blue and white border with the wave shapes is etched flashed glass. Flashed glass is a glass with, most commonly, a layer of thicker clear glass and a thin layer of an intense color, in this case blue.

I masked the flashed glass on the color side and sandblasted away the blue to give the two-color detail in a single piece of glass.
