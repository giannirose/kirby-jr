Coverintro:

Allan Price was an over-achiever in his role at the University of Oregon. His death was a loss to the community, and the new commons area associated with the science library is named in his honor.

His wife Susan Price, an artist, was asked to make an artwork to share at the building. Susan asked me to assist, and together we brought to realization this project.

The talented local metal worker (link: https://ortizmetals.com text: Randy Ortiz of Ortiz Metals) made the raised and repouss√©d metal rays that tuck neatly under the thick dark glass disk that supports gold-leafed elements. I made the pebble mosaic field. It was also a pleasure to work with Chris Roberts of opsis architecture and the UO planning staff and science department folks.
