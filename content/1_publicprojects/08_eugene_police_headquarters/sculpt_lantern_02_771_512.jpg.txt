Coverintro:

The project site is a 120 foot long wall that stretches from the public service building to the security entry gate for the police cars and impounded cars.

We oriented the chosen blocks to be ordered lines. Ellen designed the cut aluminum sculpture for a central part of the wall and a couple of topical wall inserts at the public service entry porch.

I designed three stainless steel and glass lanterns to be placed along the wall where it stepped down.

Together we designed a fused glass lantern with a stainless steel overlay entitled "Two Torches."
