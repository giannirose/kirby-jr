Newport City Hall mainimgfloat mainimagegrid1 Newport City Hall  Artwork for Newport City Hall    Together, metalsmith Greg Wilbur and I were commissioned to create artwork at  the Newport City Hall council chambers.
Newport is a coastal town; using water as a theme is encouraged and expected. We saw our design as a metaphor for political deliberations- the hard and set notion of established law  changed over time by the relentless action of the water.
Gregâ€™s work is in raised metal- thousands of hammer blows shape what begins as flat metal and, along the way, renders a pleasingly textured surface. Some elements are polished, some are toned with patina.

Sculpture detail White glass at the base reflects light through a layer of glass "stringers" and the rippling surface.    Sculpture detail Raised metal: It takes many hammer-blows for Greg to create each piece.
