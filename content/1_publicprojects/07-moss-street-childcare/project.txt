Moss Street Child Care mainimgfloat mainimggrid2rev Moss Street Child Care  Detail of the window A multitude of glass techniques were used to make the bird    Stained Glass model for the project The model for the project   “Buds, bugs, butterflies&#8230;and a bird”
The Moss Street Childcare had various classrooms named for birds, and this was my model and proposal.
Children are very taken with their immediate surroundings. Maybe it’s that they are closer to the ground and notice things like buds and bugs.
