As I write this in the spring of 2022, I am going through my glass supply and pulling out glass that I have not used and don't expect to and will therefore have for sale. Most of what I have available now is opalescent glass.

You can <a href="mailto:giannitest@comcast.net">email me</a> if you wish to set up a time to see what is available. Prices are $7 per square foot for glass that is a square foot or larger. Smaller pieces are $4 per pound. I have read that a square foot of glass is about 1.67 pounds, so the lower square foot price makes up for the smaller pieces being perhaps less useful. I also have even smaller pieces that I sell at an additional discount.

I am not a store and have no interest in becoming one. Availability is limited to stock on hand. I also sell lead. Six foot strips now cost anywhere from $9 to $12, depending on the style. That is all that I expect to be selling. Other supplies should be ordered online.

While there is a lack of suppliers in Oregon, <a href="http://www.rosesglassworks.com/">Rose's Glassworks and School</a> in Tigard (no relation) offers classes and a well-rounded collection of glass and basic  supplies. <a href="http://www.bullseyeglass.com/">Bullseye Glass</a> in Portland sells their own large production of glass along with kilns and some other supplies.
